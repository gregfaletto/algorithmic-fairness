# algorithmic-fairness
These are some resources I've developed on the topic of algorithmic fairness.

* **Algorithmic Fairness--An Overview:** These are slides for an in-class presentation I did on algorithmic fairness. They're a good place to start.
* **Algorithmic Fairness paper:** This is a paper I wrote discussing the basics of algorithmic fairness and some common fairness criteria. This paper covers the topics from the slides in more detail.
* **Fairness Criteria Examples:** These are some slides walking through an example in the setting of college admissions. I show how different possible sets of students to admit would satisfy or violate three commonly proposed standards of algorithmic fairness: *demographic parity*, *equalized odds*, and *calibration*. I created these slides for an invited talk that [Prof. Kenneth Silver](https://www.kennethmsilver.com/) (Assistant Professor in Business Ethics at Trinity College Dublin) and I gave at the [Workshop on Algorithmic Fairness](https://ps.au.dk/en/cepdisc/events/event/artikel/workshop-on-algorithmic-fairness/) hosted by the University of Copenhagen in November 2020. (The absract from our talk is [here](https://ps.au.dk/fileadmin/Statskundskab/CEPDISC/Abstracts_Copenhagen_Workshop_on_Algorithmic_Fairness_Nov_2020.pdf).)
